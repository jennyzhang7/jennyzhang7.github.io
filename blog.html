                    <p>Assuming you arrive to Bali in the Denpasar airport, the most popular places nearby to start off your trip would be Seminyak, Canggu, and Kuta. All three locations are very tourist-heavy, so expect quite a few restaurants, bars, hotels, and shopping areas. Seminyak and Canggu are known as great surfing places, while Kuta has a reputation of being a party city. If you are looking for somewhere quieter and to do some stylish shopping, I would start with Seminyak. If you are looking to get loud and crazy, then Kuta is waiting for you. Go to Canggu to surf some waves and socialize with fellow surfers. Book a couple of nights in a hostel before arriving so you have an idea of where to go when you get out of the airport. Once you arrive at a hostel, it is extremely easy to meet new friends. I suggest for all the solo travellers out there to not have every day planned and mapped out. Instead, create a list of all the activities you would like to do at each destination and look around at the hostel to see if there are other people interested in joining you. Usually other people have the same interests, and you can make some new friends along the way!<br><br> 
                        
                    The next popular destination is the beautiful Ubud. This is a must-go if you are in Bali. From peaceful temples to luscious rice fields to climbing volcanoes to hustle and bustle in the Ubud market, I guarantee that you would be able to find something to do here. Hostels usually provide shuttle bus transportation from one location to another at reasonable prices. They also usually have arranged trips to popular destinations as well. You can also ask around at tourist information desks along the roads to compare prices. <br><br> 

                    After Ubud, you have the choice to go more north, or you can go straight to the Gili islands. Personally, I absolutely LOVED the Gili's. Gili islands is composed of three islands: Trawangan, Meno, and Air. All islands have similar scenery, but their distinction come with the vibes that each island offers. Gili Trawangan is the largest and is known as the party island (but don’t worry, the loud areas are only along the main road by the dock). There are usually more tourists here and night life consists of parties by the beach. Gili Air and Meno are quieter versions of Gili Trawangan, except with Gili Meno being known as a honeymoon island. As a solo backpacker, I found it easier to meet new people and friends on Gili Trawangan, and I decided to skip Gili Meno since I had no intention of being surrounded by newly-wed couples. Don’t forget to book a snorkelling/diving trip while you’re in this area, it’s definitely worth it!<br><br> 

                    After the Gili’s, some people decide to go to Lombok, if not back to Bali. I am told that Lombok is beautiful, and is a less touristy, more peaceful version of Bali. Try it out if you have time! There are some people who go even more east from here to visit the other islands. <br><br> 

                    And that’s all there is to it! Feel free to use this as a rough guideline to plan your travel route in Bali. My advice is to book hostels as you go along (and only book for 1-2 nights at a time), so you are free to go whichever destination you prefer next. Maybe you met someone cool and would like to modify your plans to join theirs, or maybe you love where you were staying and would like to extend it for a few more nights. Whatever the reason, keep your plans flexible! Oh, and don’t forget your umbrella if you are going during rainy season! </p>
